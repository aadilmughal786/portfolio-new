# Theoretical Computer Science Basics

Theoretical computer science (TCS) underpins modern computing, covering algorithms, computability, and complexity. This article introduces its core concepts.

## Key Areas of TCS

- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures for solving problems, like sorting or searching.
- **Computability**: What can and cannot be computed (e.g., the Halting Problem).
- **Complexity**: Analyzing resource usage, like time and space complexity.

## Why Study TCS?

TCS helps you design efficient systems and understand computational limits. It’s crucial for fields like cryptography and AI.

## Example: Big-O Notation

Big-O describes algorithm efficiency. For example:

- **O(1)**: Constant time, like accessing an array element.
- **O(n)**: Linear time, like searching an unsorted list.
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time, like bubble sort.

## Practical Applications

- **Cryptography**: Relies on complexity theory for secure algorithms.
- **Compilers**: Use automata theory for parsing code.
- **AI**: Leverages graph algorithms for pathfinding.

## Learning Resources

- _Introduction to the Theory of Computation_ by Michael Sipser.
- Online courses like Stanford’s CS Theory on Coursera.

## Conclusion

TCS provides the foundation for understanding computing. Explore its concepts to become a more thoughtful and effective developer.
