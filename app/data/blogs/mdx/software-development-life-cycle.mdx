# Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework for building software systematically. This article explains its phases and methodologies.

## SDLC Phases

1. **Planning**: Define goals, scope, and resources.
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Gather user needs.
3. **Design**: Create system architecture.
4. **Implementation**: Write and test code.
5. **Testing**: Verify functionality and performance.
6. **Deployment**: Release the software.
7. **Maintenance**: Fix bugs and add features.

## Methodologies

- **Waterfall**: Linear, ideal for fixed requirements.
- **Agile**: Iterative, suited for dynamic projects. Uses sprints and Scrum.
- **DevOps**: Combines development and operations for continuous delivery.

## Example: Agile Workflow

In a sprint, create a backlog:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "task": "Implement login page", "priority": "high" },
  { "id": 2, "task": "Write unit tests", "priority": "medium" }
]
```

Track progress in tools like Jira or Trello.

## Best Practices

- Communicate clearly with stakeholders.
- Automate testing with CI/CD pipelines.
- Document code and decisions for maintainability.

## Conclusion

Understanding the SDLC improves project outcomes. Adopt Agile or DevOps for flexibility, and tailor the process to your teamâ€™s needs.
