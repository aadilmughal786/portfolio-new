# Discrete Mathematics for Coders

Discrete mathematics deals with distinct, countable structures, making it essential for programming and algorithms. This article covers its key concepts.

## Core Topics

- **Set Theory**: Understand unions, intersections, and subsets.
- **Graph Theory**: Model networks, like social media connections.
- **Logic**: Use propositions for conditionals in code.
- **Combinatorics**: Calculate permutations and combinations.

## Example: Graph Traversal

Implement a depth-first search (DFS) in Python:

```python
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    return visited
```

## Applications in Coding

- **Databases**: Use set theory for query optimization.
- **Cryptography**: Apply number theory for encryption.
- **AI**: Leverage graphs for recommendation systems.

## Learning Tips

- Study _Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications_ by Kenneth Rosen.
- Practice problems on Brilliant.org.
- Apply concepts in coding projects, like building a maze solver.

## Conclusion

Discrete math strengthens your ability to tackle complex problems. Start with one topic, like graphs, and apply it to a project to see its impact.
