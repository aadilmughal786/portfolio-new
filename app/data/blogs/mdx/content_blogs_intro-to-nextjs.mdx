# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that simplifies building modern web applications with features like static site generation, server-side rendering, and API routes.

## Why Choose Next.js?

- **Static Exports**: Generate HTML files for hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
- **App Router**: Use the new `app` directory for improved routing.
- **MDX Support**: Write content with Markdown and JSX using `@next/mdx`.

## Example: Static Blog

Here's a simple Next.js page:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>;
}
```
