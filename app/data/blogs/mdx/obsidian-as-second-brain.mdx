# Obsidian as Second Brain

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking tool that acts as a “second brain” for developers, helping organize ideas and knowledge. This article explores how to use it effectively.

## Why Obsidian?

Obsidian uses Markdown files and a graph view to link notes, creating a networked knowledge base. It’s offline, customizable, and perfect for coders.

## Setting Up Obsidian

1. Download Obsidian from obsidian.md.
2. Create a vault (folder) for your notes.
3. Install plugins like Dataview for dynamic queries.

## Organizing Notes

- **Daily Notes**: Log tasks and ideas daily.
- **Tags**: Use `#coding` or `#project` for categorization.
- **Links**: Connect notes with `[[Note Title]]` for relationships.

## Example: Code Snippets

Store a snippet in a note:

````markdown
# React Hook Example

```tsx
const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return { count, increment: () => setCount(count + 1) };
};
```
````

```

Link it to a project note with `[[React Hook Example]]`.

## Plugins for Developers

- **Code Block Enhancer**: Syntax highlighting for 100+ languages.
- **Obsidian Git**: Version control for notes.
- **Tasks**: Manage todos within notes.

## Best Practices

- Keep notes atomic (one idea per note).
- Review your graph view weekly to spot connections.
- Back up your vault to GitHub.

## Conclusion

Obsidian transforms how you manage knowledge. Start with a few notes, experiment with plugins, and build a system that fuels your productivity.
