# Essential Dev Tools for 2025

In the fast-evolving tech world, the right developer tools can make or break your productivity. This article highlights the best tools for 2025, covering coding, debugging, and collaboration.

## Code Editors and IDEs

- **Visual Studio Code**: Lightweight, customizable, and packed with extensions like Prettier and ESLint for code formatting.
- **JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA**: Ideal for Java, Kotlin, and full-stack development with powerful refactoring tools.

## Version Control

- **Git**: The backbone of modern development. Use platforms like GitHub or GitLab for hosting and collaboration.
- **GitKraken**: A GUI for Git that simplifies branching and merging.

## Debugging and Testing

- **Postman**: Perfect for testing APIs with an intuitive interface for crafting requests.
- **Jest**: A go-to for JavaScript unit testing, especially for React applications.

## Collaboration Tools

- **Slack**: Streamlines team communication with integrations for GitHub and Jira.
- **Notion**: Great for project documentation and wikis.

## Automation and CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate workflows like testing and deployment directly from your repository.
- **Docker**: Containerize applications for consistent environments across development and production.

## Example: Setting Up VS Code

To optimize VS Code, install these extensions:

```json
{
  "recommendations": ["esbenp.prettier-vscode", "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", "ms-vscode.live-server"]
}
```

Save this as `.vscode/extensions.json` in your project to share with your team.

## Conclusion
