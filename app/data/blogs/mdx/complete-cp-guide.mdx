## Which Language Should You Choose?

Looking at competitive programming history, **C++** dominates the leaderboards. Here's why:

### Historical Evidence

- 90%+ of ICPC World Finals participants use C++
- Codeforces red-rated programmers overwhelmingly prefer C++
- Google Code Jam winners predominantly use C++

### Why C++ Wins

- **Speed**: 10-50x faster execution than Python
- **STL**: Powerful Standard Template Library with built-in data structures
- **Memory Control**: Fine-grained memory management
- **Community**: Vast competitive programming resources

### The Two-Language Strategy

However, knowing **two languages is always better**:

- **C++** for speed-critical problems
- **Python** for quick prototyping and complex string/math operations

> **Note:** For this article, we'll focus on C++ as our primary language, but I'll mention Python alternatives where relevant.

## My Competitive Programming Setup

After years of competitive programming, here's my battle-tested setup:

### VS Code with CPH Extension

**CPH (Competitive Programming Helper)** is a game-changer:

- Automatically parses test cases from problem statements
- Runs multiple test cases with one click
- Shows expected vs actual output side-by-side
- Supports custom templates

### Browser Extension: Competitive Companion

This extension works seamlessly with CPH:

- One-click problem parsing from Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.
- Automatically creates files with test cases
- Supports 25+ competitive programming platforms

### My Complete Setup Checklist

1. **VS Code** with CPH extension
2. **Competitive Companion** browser extension
3. **C++ compiler** (g++ with C++17 support)
4. **Custom snippets** for common patterns

## Playing with Bits - Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are crucial for optimization and specific problem types:

### Basic Bitwise Operations

```cpp
// Basic operations
int a = 5;  // 101 in binary
int b = 3;  // 011 in binary

cout << (a & b);  // AND: 001 = 1
cout << (a | b);  // OR:  111 = 7
cout << (a ^ b);  // XOR: 110 = 6
cout << (~a);     // NOT: ...11111010
cout << (a << 1); // Left shift: 1010 = 10
cout << (a >> 1); // Right shift: 10 = 2
```

### Useful Bit Manipulation Tricks

```cpp
// Check if number is power of 2
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}

// Count number of set bits
int countBits(int n) {
    return __builtin_popcount(n);
}

// Get rightmost set bit
int rightmostBit(int n) {
    return n & (-n);
}

// Clear rightmost set bit
int clearRightmost(int n) {
    return n & (n - 1);
}
```

### Bitmask Dynamic Programming

```cpp
// Traveling Salesman Problem using bitmask DP
int dp[1 << 20][20];  // dp[mask][last_city]

int tsp(int mask, int pos) {
    if (mask == (1 << n) - 1) return dist[pos][0];
    if (dp[mask][pos] != -1) return dp[mask][pos];

    int result = INF;
    for (int city = 0; city < n; city++) {
        if (!(mask & (1 << city))) {
            result = min(result,
                dist[pos][city] + tsp(mask | (1 << city), city));
        }
    }
    return dp[mask][pos] = result;
}
```

## My C++ Template for Contests

Here's my optimized template that saves precious minutes in contests:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Type definitions
typedef long long ll;
typedef unsigned long long ull;
typedef long double ld;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef pair<ll, ll> pll;
typedef vector<int> vi;
typedef vector<ll> vll;
typedef vector<pii> vpii;

// Macros for faster coding
#define f first
#define s second
#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define all(x) x.begin(), x.end()
#define rall(x) x.rbegin(), x.rend()
#define sz(x) (int)x.size()
#define rep(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i < b; i++)
#define per(i, a, b) for (int i = a; i >= b; i--)

// Constants
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int INF = 1e9;
const ll LINF = 1e18;
const ld EPS = 1e-9;
const ld PI = acos(-1.0);

// Fast I/O
void fast_io() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
}

// Utility functions
ll gcd(ll a, ll b) { return b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a; }
ll lcm(ll a, ll b) { return a / gcd(a, b) * b; }
ll power(ll a, ll b, ll mod = MOD) {
    ll result = 1;
    while (b > 0) {
        if (b & 1) result = (result * a) % mod;
        a = (a * a) % mod;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return result;
}

// Debug template
#ifdef LOCAL
#define debug(x) cout << #x << " = " << x << endl
#else
#define debug(x)
#endif

int main() {
    fast_io();

    int t = 1;
    // cin >> t;  // Uncomment for multiple test cases

    while (t--) {
        // Your solution here

    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Template Breakdown

- **Type definitions**: Shorter names for common types
- **Macros**: Reduce typing for repetitive operations
- **Constants**: Commonly used values
- **Fast I/O**: Significantly speeds up input/output
- **Utility functions**: GCD, LCM, modular exponentiation
- **Debug template**: Conditional debugging for local testing

## Does Typing Speed Really Matter?

**Short answer: Yes, but not as much as you think.**

### The Reality Check

- Top competitive programmers type 60-80 WPM (not 120+ WPM)
- Thinking time >> Typing time for most problems
- Code efficiency matters more than typing speed

### Why Typing Speed Helps

- **Less context switching**: Keeps you in the flow
- **Faster implementation**: More time for debugging
- **Reduced frustration**: Smooth coding experience
- **Better contest performance**: Every second counts

### My Recommendation

Aim for **60+ WPM** with good accuracy. Use [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) for practice:

1. **Start with 15-minute daily sessions**
2. **Focus on accuracy over speed**
3. **Practice programming-specific words**
4. **Use proper finger positioning**
5. **Gradually increase difficulty**

> **Tip:** Set MonkeyType to "code" mode to practice programming-specific vocabulary like "vector", "algorithm", "iostream", etc.

## Should I Focus on Development or Competitive Programming?

This is the million-dollar question. Here's my balanced approach:

### The 70-30 Rule

- **70% Development**: Building real-world projects
- **30% Competitive Programming**: Sharpening algorithmic skills

### Why This Balance Works

**Development Benefits:**

- Industry-relevant skills
- Portfolio building
- Understanding system design
- Learning frameworks and tools
- Building complete applications

**Competitive Programming Benefits:**

- Strong problem-solving foundation
- Interview preparation
- Algorithmic thinking
- Code optimization skills
- Handling time pressure

### My Recommended Schedule

**Weekly Schedule:**

- **Monday-Friday**: Focus on development projects
- **Saturday**: Competitive programming contests
- **Sunday**: Practice problems and algorithm study

**Daily Schedule (2-3 hours coding):**

- **1.5-2 hours**: Development work
- **30-60 minutes**: Competitive programming practice

### Career Path Considerations

**If you want to work at:**

- **Big Tech (Google, Meta, Amazon)**: 50-50 split
- **Startups**: 80% development, 20% competitive programming
- **Research roles**: 40% development, 60% competitive programming
- **Competitive programming teams**: 20% development, 80% competitive programming

## Final Thoughts

Competitive programming is a marathon, not a sprint. The journey from beginner to expert typically takes 1-2 years of consistent practice. Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than just solving problems mechanically.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. The key is consistency, patience, and continuous learning. Start today, practice daily, and trust the process.

**Your competitive programming adventure begins now. What problem will you solve first?**
